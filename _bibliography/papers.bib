  title={A Data-Driven Algorithm Based on YOLOv8 for Object Detection, Tracking, Distance Estimation, and Size Measurement in Stereo Vision Systems},
  author={Dadashzadeh, A. and Haghzad Klidbary, S.},
  abstract={Stereo vision systems, inspired by human visual perception, can infer depth from images using two cameras. This study emphasizes explicitly the measurement of distance and the size of objects of interest, both critical components for many autonomous and robotic systems. As DL and ML continue to advance within computer vision applications, adapting traditional algorithms into modern machine learning-based solutions promises heightened accuracy. Our investigation uses the YOLOv8 object detection model to identify objects of interest. Our algorithm involves a data-driven approach toward distance and size measurement by training a neural network to predict the distance and size of objects within a stereo vision system. The key innovation of this method lies in the neural network’s ability to learn and model the relationship between disparity and distance, as well as width and height, through real-world data collection. The proposed algorithm eliminates the heavy reliance on mathematical formulas typically tied to calibration processes. In our experiments, conducted at distances ranging from 50 to 200 centimeters, our proposed algorithm showcased accurate performance. It achieved distance measurements with an accuracy of up to 99.99\% in select cases and maintained the mean accuracy of 98.15\% for distance, 92.87\% for width, and 93.92\% for height measurements.},
