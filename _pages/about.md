I earned my Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering from the [University of Zanjan](https://www.znu.ac.ir/en), guided by the expertise of [Dr. Sajad Haghzad Klidbari](https://www.znu.ac.ir/members/haghzad/en). The culmination of my undergraduate studies was the development of the [Stereo Center](https://github.com/shervindadashzade/stereo-center), an innovative electronic monitoring system utilizing stereo vision. This system, dedicated to object detection, distance measurement, and size estimation, not only showcased my technical skills but also ignited a profound passion for impactful research and development in Machine Learning and Deep Learning, particularly within the realm of Computer Vision.

**Currently**, I am pursuing my Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence at [Institute for Advanced Studies in Basic Sciences](https://iasbs.ac.ir), under the supervision of [Dr. Mohsen Hooshmand](https://iasbs.ac.ir/~mohsen.hooshmand/). My research interests have evolved in tandem with my academic journey, encompassing:
- `Machine Learning`
- `Deep Learning`
- `Computer Vision`
- `Bioinformatics`
- `Quantum Computing`(recently).

While I've dedicated approximately two years to the study of Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Computer Vision, I am embarking on a new chapter to explore the fascinating realms of Bioinformatics and Quantum Computing during my M.Sc. These uncharted fields present exciting opportunities for me to broaden my knowledge and contribute to cutting-edge advancements in technology.
